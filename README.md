Key Points
1.	We present a new, continent-wide archive of U-Th dates and isotopic data from Antarctic subglacial chemical precipitates.
2.	We show that the precipitates are correlated to millennial-scale warming events in the Southern Ocean, and that they likely form as part of an ice sheet response to these events.
3.	We also show that the precipitate dates tend to cluster during periods when millennial-scale variability is enhanced and global ice volume is high.

Abstract
Subglacial calcite precipitation is thought to occur in East Antarctica during periods when warm Southern Ocean waters access the ice sheet margin. Here we present an expanded precipitate archive that includes a continent-wide compilation of 40 new and previously reported calcite U-Th ages with isotopic compositional data. These age and geochemical data are interpreted to record periods when interior meltwaters are exported to the ice sheet margins as a result of ice acceleration and thinning. An assessment of coincidence between U-Th dates, ranging from 16-256 ka, and peaks in Southern Ocean temperature yields a statistically significant correlation. Additional comparison between climate conditions at periods of calcite formation and climate conditions across the entire time interval of the study finds that calcite formation and ice acceleration cluster within periods of enhanced millennial scale variability as well as high global ice volume. This sensitivity to background climate is consistent with the hypothesis that these factors exert some control on ice sheet response to changes in climate.
